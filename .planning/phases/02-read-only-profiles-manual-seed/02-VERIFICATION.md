# Phase 2: Read-Only Profiles + Manual Seed — Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** A researcher can navigate to `/companies/[slug]` for any of 50-200 manually-seeded Korean startups and read a hero section, funding-round table, Korean alias list, and primary identifiers — every fact carrying an inline source badge with last-verified date and a freshness color dot.

**Verified:** 2026-04-22T12:10:00Z
**Status:** gaps_found (seed quantity only; all behavioral contracts met)
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## 목표 달성 요약 (Goal Achievement Summary)

구현 전반은 견고하다. 4개 CRITICAL 브랜드 패밀리(토스/당근/쿠팡/배민)는 라이브 DB에 시드되어 있고, `/ko/companies/[slug]` 라우트는 ISR(`revalidate = 3600`) + 슬러그 정규식 게이트(V5) + `notFound()` 이중 경로가 모두 동작한다. `Hero → AliasList → FundingRoundsTable → IdentifierList` D-03 순서가 DOM에 반영되어 있고, `SourceBadge`가 `출처: {sourceLabel} · {date}` 형식과 `FRESHNESS_DOT_CLASS` 기반 신선도 도트를 매 fact-row에 렌더한다. 76/76 단위 테스트 + 20/20 스모크 테스트가 라이브 dev 서버 대상 그린.

**유일한 갭**은 시드 수량이다 — 계획 내부 목표 ≥20, 로드맵 범위 50-200 대비 15개만 시드되었다. SRCH-13을 해제하기 위한 4개 CRITICAL 브랜드는 모두 존재하므로 Phase 3은 블록되지 않는다.

## Observable Truths

| # | Truth (ROADMAP Success Criterion) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | SC #1: `/companies/[seeded-slug]` shows hero (logo/name_ko/name_en/sector/HQ/one-liner/website), funding table with full stage taxonomy + 억/조 formatting, current + past Korean aliases | ✓ VERIFIED | `page.tsx` composes Hero+AliasList+FundingRoundsTable+IdentifierList (line 56-59); `Hero.tsx` renders displayNameKo/En, sector Badge, hqAddress, websiteUrl with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`; `FundingRoundsTable.tsx` uses `stageLabel()` covering all 11 ENUM values + `formatKRW()` for 억/조; `AliasList.tsx` renders current (semibold legal) + former (line-through) with year ranges |
| 2 | SC #2: Every fact renders inline "출처: …" badge + green/yellow/red freshness dot reflecting `last_verified_at` age (≤30d / ≤180d / >180d) | ✓ VERIFIED | `SourceBadge.tsx` consumes `FRESHNESS_DOT_CLASS` (text-green-600/amber-500/red-600 + dark variants) + `freshnessLevel(meta.lastVerifiedAt)`; rendered once per fact row per D-01; smoke test TRUST-04 (`출처:` present) and TRUST-05 (color class present) both green |
| 3 | SC #3: Page reads correctly on 375px mobile | ✓ VERIFIED | Human-verify approved per Plan 02-06 checkpoint #2 ("approved — 375 px viewport checks pass, visual tone holds"); 5 polish fixes landed inline (hamburger nav, compact source badge, legal-alias bold, identifier stacking, 억원 rendering) |
| 4 | SC #4: ISR with 1-hour revalidate; footer shows disclaimer copy | ✓ VERIFIED | `page.tsx:32` exports `revalidate = 3600`; `companies.ts:248` wraps `fetchCompanyBySlug` in `unstable_cache(… { tags: [\`company:\${slug}\`], revalidate: 3600 })`; `(public)/layout.tsx` inherits `footer.tsx` → `Disclaimer` component auto-mounted; smoke test 'TRUST-06 inherited' green — `<1s on 4G` sub-clause deferred to Phase 8 LAUNCH-05 |
| 5 | SC #5: 50-200 seed companies committed with `source_id → manual_curation` data_sources row, enabling Phase 3 search QA | ✗ FAILED (partial) | 15 companies live-seeded (`scripts/seed/companies/index.ts`); all 4 CRITICAL brand families + 11 diversity picks correct; SRCH-13 fixture assertions green; **quantity below the 50-200 roadmap range and below the plan's internal ≥20 target**; source_id = MANUAL_SOURCE_ID correctly set on every row |

**Score:** 4/5 truths verified

## Deferred Items

아래 항목은 **현재 Phase 2 범위 밖**이거나 **미래 단계에서 명시적으로 다뤄진다** — 실제 갭이 아니다.

| 2 | 전체 50-200개 + 그 이상 프로덕션 시드 확장 | Phase 8 (LAUNCH-03) | Phase 8 SC #4: "≥5,000 verified companies are seeded (DART + K-Startup + manual + curated submissions)" |
| 3 | "<1s on 4G simulation" 성능 예산 집행 | Phase 8 (LAUNCH-05) | Phase 8 SC #5: "k6 or Artillery… 5,000 simulated concurrent requests… p95 <1s" — Phase 2는 ISR 프리미티브(revalidate=3600)만 제공 |

## Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `src/components/site/mobile-nav.tsx` | 87 | TS2322: `string` not assignable to `RouteImpl` for `Link href` | ⚠️ Warning | Unrelated Phase 1 header file touched in Plan 02-06 hamburger fix; doesn't break prod builds (Next's own build ignores noEmit-only checks) but pollutes `tsc --noEmit`. Should be fixed in a Phase 3 cleanup or as a Phase 2 gap-closure. |
| `public/logos/*.png` | — | 0-byte PNG placeholders | ℹ️ Info | All 15 PNGs empty. `CompanyLogo` branches to letter-avatar on `logoUrl === null`, but current seed sets `logo_file: 'toss.png'` etc., so the `<Image>` request hits a 0-byte file — browser renders broken-image icon. Consider either (a) populating real art, or (b) reverting `logoUrl` to `null` in seed until art lands to force letter-avatar fallback. Documented as curator follow-up in Plan 02-05 SUMMARY. |
| `src/lib/data/companies.ts` | 143, 173, 193, 221 | `sourceMetaFromRow(src, …)` null-unsafe when joined `data_sources` row is missing | ℹ️ Info (WR-01 from REVIEW) | Called out by code reviewer; would throw if `data_sources.deleted_at != null` or RLS grants fail — kills page render. Phase 2 seed always hydrates the source row so no live exposure, but brittle for Phase 4a ETL integration. Not a Phase 2 blocker. |
| `scripts/seed/seed.ts` | 136-237 | Non-atomic delete-then-insert per company | ℹ️ Info (WR-02 from REVIEW) | No transaction wrapping; mid-seed failure could leave a company with old funding_rounds + new aliases. Idempotent on re-run, so blast radius small. Not a Phase 2 blocker. |
| `src/lib/data/freshness.ts` | 16-24 | `differenceInDays(now, InvalidDate)` silently returns 'expired' | ℹ️ Info (WR-05 from REVIEW) | Data-quality issue masked as legitimate staleness. Live seed always produces valid ISO dates so no live exposure. Not a Phase 2 blocker. |

See `02-REVIEW.md` for the full 15-finding review (0 critical, 6 warning, 9 info) — none are Phase 2 goal-blockers.

## Human Verification Required

None remaining. 375 px viewport checkpoint was executed and approved during Plan 02-06 Task 2 ("approved — 375 px viewport checks pass, visual tone holds") with 5 polish fixes landed inline.

## Gaps Summary

**Single gap blocking passed status**: ROADMAP Phase 2 Success Criterion #5 specifies **50-200 manually-seeded Korean startups**. Actual live DB carries **15** (all 4 CRITICAL brand families required by Phase 3 SRCH-13 + 11 sector-diverse picks). Plan 02-05 SUMMARY §Deviations item 4 acknowledges the delta vs the plan's ≥20 internal target; the roadmap contract is stricter.

**Why this is gap_found, not passed:**
- All behavioral contracts are met (4/5 Success Criteria fully verified).
- The phase goal statement explicitly reads "any of 50-200 manually-seeded Korean startups" — 15 is below the lower bound.
- Phase 3 SRCH-13 is NOT blocked (4 CRITICAL brand families seeded), so shipping Phase 3 work can begin in parallel.

**Why this is NOT status: human_needed:**
- The decision is **scope**, not **verification uncertainty** — a developer needs to decide whether to (a) add 5+/35+ more seed modules now, or (b) update ROADMAP.md SC #5 to explicitly scope Phase 2 to the CRITICAL+diversity set and defer full 50-200 to the existing Phase 8 LAUNCH-03 ≥5k seed gate. Both paths are viable.

**Recommended closure options** (user picks):
1. **Expand seed now:** Add 5+ curated company modules to hit ≥20; re-run `/gsd-plan-phase --gaps` with focus on tranche 3.
2. **Override with scope clarification:** Accept 15 as Phase-2 complete by adding an `overrides:` entry acknowledging that the 50-200 range is Phase 8 LAUNCH-03's binding contract, with Phase 2's purpose being the CRITICAL-brand cold-start that unblocks SRCH-13. Amend ROADMAP.md SC #5 accordingly.

**This looks intentional.** To accept this deviation, add to VERIFICATION.md frontmatter:

```yaml
overrides:
  - must_have: "ROADMAP SC #5 — 50-200 seed companies committed"
    reason: "Phase 2 ships the 4 CRITICAL brand families (토스/당근/쿠팡/배민) + 11 diversity picks needed to unblock Phase 3 SRCH-13 Korean regression suite. Full 50-200+ seed expansion is handled by Phase 8 LAUNCH-03 (≥5,000 verified companies). ROADMAP.md SC #5 should be amended to scope Phase 2 to the SRCH-13 cold-start set."
